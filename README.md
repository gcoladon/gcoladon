## Welcome to my experimental new home page

This seems like a good place to include a link to one of the organizations I'm responsible for:

**Repair Cafe Mountain View**

- [Website](http://repaircafemv.org)
- [FB page](http://fb.com/RepairCafeMountainView)

I would like to find the time to create websites that would help me and others

- Track experiments they do and share their results with others
- Commune with other users of MIT's OpenCourseWare classes 
- More easily keep track of what's going on at City Council and on the School Board
